**Are you fucking serious? Why are you trying to craft a bell?
 Its clearly uncraftable, even a fucking toddler knows that.
 Do you not see the parameters of this fucking command?
 Read the fine print. CANNOT CRAFT UNCRAFTABLE ITEMS.
 Can you get that into your thick skull? BELLS ARE UNCRAFTABLE.
 Go on the Wiki, read about it and find other ways to obtain it,
 but STOP TRYING TO CRAFT THE DAMN THING. This is your final warning.
 You will be permanently wiped off this plane of existence if you attempt
 to do something so idiotic again.**
